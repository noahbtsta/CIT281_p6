Learned that classes in Javascript are a template for creating objects. Gained expereince creating 
classes with different characteristics and properties. Practiced inheriting classes within one and other.
Gained more experience using a generic block of code to process data.

- Created 3 classes:
   - A Shape class that serves as a base for the other two
   - A Rectangle class that is inherited from Shape class
   - A Triangle class that is inherited from Shape class

- Tested classes using:
